#A basic  E-commerce website
We are creating an Online medical store for public use to provide access to essential requirements during this trying time, we would be creating an authorization page where new users could register or old user can login. The store would be user friendly and easy to navigate, the main page would show various categories of medicine and their associated health problem. 

Offers would be displayed on the homepage, a medical article would be created for latest medical updates. Masks would be given a special category. 
A cart would be created for saving selection of medicine of the user, once confirmed they would be taken to the payment gateway where a receipt would be generated. The working of this website will be divided into parts/modules and distributed among the group members. Each module would be described in detail.
